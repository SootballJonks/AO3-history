# AO3 HISTORY SCRAPER

So this is probably the worst thing I've ever created. It's a tool that you can use to out yourself as the depraved individual you are.


Since you need to be logged into AO3 for it to scrape your user data, you will need to set up your .env (dotenv) file to contain your login info. Don't fret, my paranoid non-techie friends who want to try this out - the file is local, and you'll make it yourself.

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Download the project and throw it somewhere.

2. Set up your `.env` file with the following:

```
AO3_USERNAME=your_username
AO3_PASSWORD=your_password
```

3. run `npm install` to set the stuff up.

4. run `node scraper.mjs` and sit back, twiddle your thumbs, take a nap, etc. , because if you're like me you probably have like 100 pages of user history.

5. If it all goes according to plan, at some point the code will finish and you will have a cursed excel spreadsheet to look at. Make it extra cursed and throw that sucker into some sort of data visualization software. 
- Make a cursed Word Cloud with the phrases ~~cum inflation~~ and ~~daddy kink~~ in big, bold letters. Share it with friends.
- See how many total words you've read. Do the math to figure out how much of your life you've wasted on fanfiction.
- Find out which fandom has been holding your attention the most. Cringe at the answer.
